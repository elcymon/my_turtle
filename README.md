# my_turtle
This repo implements a number of turtlebot navigation algorithms used for collecting sound data from a microphone

SWHear.py was developed by http://github.com/swharden.

I have included minimal changes to the class in SWHear2.py so that it can hold multiple chunks of audio stream in memory.
